When faced with a new problem, where do you look for inspiration?

Most people look to solutions of previous problems that have 
similar characteristics.

This insight is what is behind design patterns; collections 
of proven ways to structure the relationships between objects 
in the pursuit of a given objective.

A pattern is really nothing ore than an attempt to document 
a proven solution to a problem so that future problems can 
be more easily handled in a similar fashion.


Many patterns are involved with the concepts of dependency 
we introduced in the previous chapter.

Determining where strong dependencies are necessary, and 
how to weaken dependencies whenever possible.
