The most important features of this case study:

The use of inheritance and overriding in the card piles:
* Reduces code development
* Insures common behavior
* Makes possible the polymorphic evaluation of draw and select

The way we have isolated the card data and the card view
* An abstract class for views
* An implementation of the abstract class for .new specific implementation
* How we have isolated the .net specific interface from the rest of the application.
